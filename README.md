### Gitalytics

> Because stars don't tell the whole story.



## The Problem

Ever chosen an open-source library based on GitHub stars only to discover it's:

- Abandoned by maintainers?
- Slow to resolve critical issues?
- Lacking proper documentation?
- Riddled with unresolved bugs?


Stars lie. Gitalytics doesn't.

## The Solution

Gitalytics analyzes what actually matters:

- 📊 Commit frequency and consistency
- ⏱️ Issue resolution and PR review times
- 👥 Community size and engagement
- 📝 Documentation quality
- 🧪 Estimated test coverage

## Get Started

```shellscript
npm install
npm run dev
```
